# Topic tracker

## What?

Browsing the Facebook group and answering support type of questions can be very tedious and time consuming task.

This app aims to help tracking topics in the FB group and mark them with tags and/or solved/not solved and categorize them.
Users and admins could save a lot of support time for checking the group and to see where more attention is needed. This might
also provide a bit more friendly way to help people deal with their development issues.

## Installation
